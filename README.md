# Interns in Technology Salaries 2018 Report
## Introduction
It seems to me that many students struggle when it comes to negotiating salaries or they are unaware of current market rates and as a result they are being underpaid. I conducted this “research” in order to help students to get an idea how much technology companies across the UK pay. Unfortunately I only got 54 responses, but I still think it is a valuable source of information and it will help many people.
## Pre-Processing the Data
Before analysing the data I made some effort to unify it. The changes I made are not big and a raw data can be found in this repository. For example I fixed words capitalisation and some obvious mistakes (annual salary of £38 is clearly a typo). I also blanked some ambiguous answers like “start up”, etc.
## Salaries by Location
Not much surprise here. Interns in London are paid the highest due to the high cost of living and, I suppose, because of the concretion of big fintech companies in the area. However it is sad to see some companies still pay £15000 in London that it is not enough to live in the capitol.

## Salaries by Company
I think no surprises here either. Fintech companies are the one paying the most. The only two exceptions are The Hut Group and Improbable (the winner in this category!). Again it is a bit disappointing to see some big names paying salaries close to the minimum wage.

## Bonuses
Not much to say the graph shows everything.

## Extra comments
I was surprised to find out some inters got a pay rise during their internship based on a good performance. Also it is nice to see that at least one company helps with relocation.
## Conclusion
I will leave everyone to make their own conclusion, but it looks like to me some companies are taking advantage of either their big names or the fact many students are not sure how much their skills are worth – I really think many students lack a confidence and do not believe in themselves, but that is outside the scope here.

I hope this small research will help anyone looking for a job to negotiate a higher salary.

I got inspired by Sami’s article written some times ago [link](https://medium.com/@smi_abd/interns-in-tech-salaries-uk-9239c5812294). Also I would like to thank everyone who filled the survey.
